# godsarmy-export-plugin
GodsArmy Website plugin for Summoners War Exporter (SWEX)

# How to "install"
1. Download the latest version release (asar file) - https://github.com/ga-rude/godsarmy-export-plugin/releases/latest
2. Put the plugin asar file in {SWEX Files Path}/plugins
3. Restart SWEX and activate GodsArmy-Export Plugin in SWEX's Settings

# Updating profiles
Profiles will be added to the import queue on the webserver, so it might take ~15 minutes for them to appear on the website. Also, scanned monsters can only updated once a day to prevent spamming.
